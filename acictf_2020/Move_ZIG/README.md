**Prompt:** 
* CATS is back at it on challenge.acictf.com:55349. Only this time he's throwing 500 problems at you. If you didn't use a program to solve the last one, you'll probably want this...

**Hints:** 
* We'll be impressed if you solve this without writing code. The hints on 'All Your Base Are Belong to Us' are still relevant here as well.

**Solution:**
* Same as before, but you can't do it by hand at all (500 iterations).
* See [All Your Base Are Belong to Us](https://github.com/omyej/ctf/tree/master/acictf_2020/All_Your_Base_Are_Belong_to_Us) for the code.
